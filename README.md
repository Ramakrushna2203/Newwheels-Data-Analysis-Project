# Newwheels-Data-Analysis-Project
📌 Project Overview

NewWheels is a pre-owned vehicle resale company offering end-to-end services—from vehicle listing to delivery and after-sales support—through a mobile application.

Over the past year, NewWheels has experienced:

Declining sales

Increasing negative customer feedback

Reduced customer acquisition

To address these challenges, the CEO requested a quarterly business performance report covering customer behavior, revenue trends, order patterns, and operational efficiency.

This project uses SQL to analyze business data and derive actionable insights for leadership decision-making.
